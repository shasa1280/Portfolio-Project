    <h1> About Me</h1>
  <h2>Hi, I'm Shasa Boshoff</h2>
<p>When the company I had worked for shutdown during the 2020 global pandemic,
  my partner encouraged me to join a course and learn a new skill.
  Having seen several ads for <em><a hre="www.shecodes.io">SheCodes</a> </em>pop up on my Facebook news feed,
  I decided to test it out!  I clicked on the learn more button and signed up for the sample workshop.</p>

<p> I have always been pretty good with computers and was interested in learning more about coding. The
  idea of building some thing from nothing really excited me and after the sample workshop, what can I say? I was hooked.
   I enjoy the intricacies of coding and love learning the different ways to manipulate designs through CSS. I am just
   about to finish my 15th week in this training program and I know that the sky is the limit!</p>

<p> In the future, I look forward to the opportunity to help designers, small agencies and businesses
  bring their ideas to life. Powered by Github, VS Code and coffee ☕, I can’t wait to see what the future holds!</p>
